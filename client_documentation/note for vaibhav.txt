Website should have as many sections as mentioned here.

For the Products section, refer to our competitor website https://atplgroup.in/ 
For each of the categories of the products mentioned in the word file, refer to the excel file 'Products Catalogue'
For eg. , for the product 'Admixtures', we should have 7 admixture names as listed in the catalogue with a suitable logo.
When user clicks on the logo , the page displayed should show Description, 'Usage' and 'Advantages' of the product.

For the Projects section
there will be 5 drop downs- Bullet train, Metro & Rail, Roads, Buildings&Infra, and Others
Each will have photos and text as mentioned in the word file.

I have included photos which will we have to posted in the approvals section, clients section and projects section.
